**EngWordsApp** is an app designed to help users learn English vocabulary through flashcards. It offers different modules, each containing words that users can first review and study using flashcards (with the word on one side and its translation on the other).

## **Key Features:**

- **Flashcard Learning:**  
  Users can go through word lists by studying the flashcards, which help reinforce vocabulary with translations.

- **Practice Exercises:**  
  Once users are familiar with the words, they can test their knowledge with various exercises:

    - **Writing:**  
      Users see the translation and must type the correct English word.

    - **Quizzes:**  
      Multiple-choice tests for vocabulary recall.

    - **Matching:**  
      Pair the correct word with its translation.

    - **True/False:**  
      A combination of word and translation is shown, and users swipe to indicate if the pair is correct or not.

- **Analytics:**  
  After each exercise, the app provides detailed feedback, showing which answers were correct or incorrect and giving the correct solutions.

- **Endless Practice:**  
  Exercises are regenerated each time, allowing users to repeat them as many times as they like for ongoing practice.
